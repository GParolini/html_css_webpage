             <b> Born on 4th July 1848 in Paris. Died in Paris on 16th March 1924. </b> <br> Angot studied physics and mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure (1868-1872). After his degree, he briefly worked as assistant at the Collège de France (1872-1874). He then took part in astronomic expeditions in New Caledonia (1874) and the United States (1878). These international travels enabled him to visit astronomical and meteorological observatories in the United States facilitating his following career in meteorology. <br>In 1879 Angot was appointed “météorologiste titulaire” at the French Central Meteorological Bureau in Paris, where he worked during all his life, eventually becoming its third director in 1907. He retired from the Bureau in 1920, when the French geophysical services were reorganised. Angot’s scientific research spanned meteorological observations and meteorological instruments, the study of climatology, solar radiation, geomagnetic and astronomic phenomena. With his directorship of the French Meteorological Bureau, Angot also became the representative of the French meteorological services in the International Meteorological Organization. <br> Alongside his career within the meteorological Bureau, since 1879 Angot was engaged in teaching physics and meteorology at the French Institut National Agronomique, making him an ideal candidate for the presidency of the IMO Commission for Agricultural Meteorology. Due to his interest in the application of meteorology to agriculture, Angot was also a member of the French Académie d’Agriculture. <br> Angot’s scientific research was mainly published in the Annales du Bureau Central Météorologique, the official publication of the French meteorological services. He also published a few meteorological textbooks that went through several editions. <br> In his time Angot was a notable member of scientific circles in France and abroad. He was an honorary member of the Royal Meteorological Society, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences, of the Geographical Society of Roumania.

          <p> <b> Born on 12th January 1880 in Oudorp, The Netherlands. Died on 23rd March 1973 in the Netherlands.</b> <br> Braak obtained his doctorate at Leiden University in 1908 and there remained as assistant for a few months before taking up an appointment at the Dutch Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory in Batavia in August 1908. Braak spent many years in Java studying the climate of the Dutch East Indies and in 1920 he became the director of the Batavia observatory.Five years later, in 1925, he was offered the directorship of the climatology department of the KNMI in de Bilt. He maintained this position until his retirement at the end of 1947. During his forty-years career in meteorology, Braak focused mainly on climatology both in the Dutch colonies and in the Netherlands, publishing several contributions on the topic. During the 1930s and 1940s, his department also strengthened research work in agricultural meteorology examining the influence of weather on crops. Braak gained an international profile as a member of the International Meteorological Organization. He was at first secretary and then president of the IMO Commission for Agricultural Meteorology.

In August 1919 he became the director of the Meteorological Observatory Breslau-Krietern and from 1923 he was also in charge of the weather service in Breslau-Krietern. He moved to Palestine around 1936 and became head of the Aviation Forecasting Service in 1937, when Palestine was still a British mandate.

            <p> <b> Born on 24th August 1894 in Erlangen, Germany. Died in Munich on 22nd January 1981. </b> <br> Geiger studied physics and mathematics at the universities of Erlangen and Kiel from 1912 to 1915 and gained his doctorate in Erlangen in 1920. Completed his studies, he became an assistant at the Physics Institute of the Technical University Darmstadt and there he remained until 1923, when he joined the newly founded Meteorological and Climatological Institute at the University of Munich. In Munich he became also an observer for the Bavarian Weather Service (1928-1935). During his time in Munich, Geiger began the researches on microclimatology that he continued throughout his life. In 1937 he moved to the Forestry Academy in Eberswalde as professor of meteorology, mathematics and physics. He remained in Eberswalde for a decade before returning to Munich in 1948 as professor of meteorology, climatology and microclimatology and director of the university meteorological institute. He retired in 1959. Geiger’s research on microclimatology brought him to focus on agrometeorological and forestry problems, such as frost damage and frost protection, because soil conditions and plant growth are key element in the microclimate of an area. By the time he became secretary and then president of the IMO Commission for Agricultural Meteorology in the 1930s he had already produced a wealth of publications on these topics and continued until his retirement. As part of his climatological research, Geiger contributed also to the climate classification system developed by the meteorologist Wladimir Köppen, which is widely used nowadays.

              <p> <b> Born in 1876. Died in 1946 in Paris. </b> <br> Rey began his studies at the agronomy school in Montpellier in 1896. He remained affiliated to this institution for several years working on climatological and weather forecasting problems connected to agriculture, and eventually became the director of the local meteorological station. After WWI, he became a general inspector of the newly created French Agronomy Institute (IRA) and at same time he was appointed director of the 'Station Centrale de Physique Agricole', based in Versailles, where he continued his weather and climate research. When the IRA was dismantled in the 1930s, Rey continued to work in agronomic research with different roles, until he was suspended from duties by the Vichy regime and reinstated only posthumously. Rey was a long-term member of the IMO Commission for Agricultural Meteorology, where he served from 1919 until 1937.   </p>

Died in Vienna on 27th November 1936.</b> <br>  Schmidt studied physics and mathematics at the university of Vienna and gained there his doctorate in 1905. In the same year, he began to work at the Central Office for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna where he remained until his appointment as professor of meteorology and climatology at the Vienna Hochschule für Bodenkultur in 1919. He concluded his professional career as professor of geophysics at the university of Vienna and director of the Central Office for Meteorology and Geodynamics. Schmidt’s main contributions to agricultural meteorology are his microclimatological studies aimed at understanding how temperature, humidity, and solar radiation are interconnected. Due to his scientific interests, he became a member of the subcommission on microclimatology instituted by the IMO Commission on Agricultural Meteorology. Schmidt also contributed to study frost hazards and frost protection to support Austrian farmers.
