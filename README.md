The webpage provides a timeline of the presidents, vice-presidents, and secretaries who managed the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology established by the International Meteorological Organization. In addition, for each of the members, there is a short biography available. Images, instead, are often hidden due to copyright restrictions. The user can navigate the page with the anchors provided in the text. The use of Google Chrome is recommended for the best user experience. The timeline has been produced as part of the Project "Environmental Factors in Agriculture: Observation and Experiment in Agricultural Meteorology (ca 1900-1950)" sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Project No. 321660352).
